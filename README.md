# erc-20
Implement an API for tokens within Smart Contracts.

Tokens can represent virtually anything:

* reputation points in an online platform
* skills of a character in a game
* financial assets like a share in a company
* a fiat currency like USD
* an ounce of gold

Example functionalities ERC-20 provides:

* transfer tokens from one account to another
* get the current token balance of an account
* get the total supply of the token available on the network
* approve whether an amount of token from an account can be spent by a third-party account

If a Smart Contract implements the following methods and events it can be called an ERC-20 Token Contract and, 
once deployed, it will be responsible to keep track of the created tokens onchain.
